# Electronic Brake System (E-Brake)

The kart uses an electromagnetic, normally closed (NC) switch to control the Electronic Brake (E-brake) system, which stops the rear axle.

## Normally Closed Operation

- The E-brake system relies on a normally closed electromagnetic switch, meaning that the switch remains closed in the absence of power. This engages the braking mechanism, applying force to stop the rear axle.

## Power Applied (Brake Disengaged)

- When electrical power is supplied, the electromagnetic coil is energized, opening the switch and disengaging the brake. This allows the rear axle to rotate freely during normal operation.
