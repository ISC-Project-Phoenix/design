# polynomial_planner

## Summary

This node plans a path by porjecting points into the center of the track. The general idea is to model the bounds of the tracks 
as polynomials, which are differentiable. The polynomials act as the bounds of the track which let inadverity prevents us from 
crossing off the track.

A benefit of this approach is that planning is local and very fast, which allows it to be used without localisation.

### Subscribes

- 'TBD' 'TODO' `polynomials` - Polynomial regression is applied to tracked white lines to track. TBD what frame are they in?

### Publishes

- `/path` - a nav_msgs Path to follow. These will be in our odom frame.

### Algorithm

The planner works its magic in the backend, we take the polynomials and differentiate at points on a fixed interial. The dx/dy 
is treated as a vector and its Orthogonal complements are generated and scaled accoridng. 'TBD' whether or not these will account 
for the dept of in camera space or on a fixed scaler in ROS space.


Our backend implementation is considerably simpler. It simply takes these right left sets, and creates
a path by pairing them and finding midpoints.

1. Validate each the polynomial is not null
2. Loop through the polynomial using a modiffied distance between points formula. 
3. For each point on the interval
4. We store these points in the Path Array. 
    a. then these points are projected into real world points. 
5. Transform the path array into odom
    1. this is effectively giving the pose a timmestamp and a tf2 frame ID
