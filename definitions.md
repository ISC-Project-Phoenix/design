# Definitions

This file contains definitions of common terms used throughout these docs.

- **Estop** - The estop will cut power to the motor and apply full brake power. The kart should be unable to move unless
the estop is popped, and the system is restarted.
  - The estop can be triggered from either the analog remote, or from AEB.
- **Pause** - The pause will cut power to the motor, and slowly apply brakes until the kart is stopped. It should be
electronically toggleable, and thus recoverable.
  - The pause can be triggered by either the analog remote or wifi flag.
